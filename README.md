### Contributing

- Add test cases.

   django-admin-playground welcomes values or settings that can create visual differences in the Django Admin.
   Please add a ModelAdmin or fixture with specific values that can create visual differences.
   (Refer to this [document](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/django-admin/#dumpdata) for instructions on how to add fixtures.)

- Keep Django Admin templates up-to-date.

   The [before_admin](https://github.com/Antoliny0919/django-admin-playground/tree/main/templates/before_admin) template folder must always stay up-to-date with the latest [Django Admin templates](https://github.com/django/django/tree/main/django/contrib/admin/templates/admin).
   If there are any changes in the Django Admin templates, the template files in the `before_admin` folder must be kept identical.
   If the Django Admin templates have been modified, please reflect those changes in the `before_admin` templates!

   If you have any ideas or items that could improve the contribution environment, don‚Äôt hesitate to create an Issue.
